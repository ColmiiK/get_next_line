# get_next_line
This project consists of developing and implementing a function that when called, it returns the first line of a given file descriptor. Subsequent calls of the function return subsequent lines of the file.
Multiple file descriptors are supported when using the `_bonus` version of the function.

This function, along with `ft_printf`, is already implemented in my `libft` library. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/ColmiiK/libft).
